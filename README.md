## Project Description

TimeTalks is a redesigned YouTube mobile comment interface that dynamically adapts to the videoâ€™s playback. It clusters user comments based on timestamps and topics using AI, providing a clean, intuitive way to engage with reactions at specific video momentsâ€”without breaking the familiar YouTube UX.

This system enhances contextual engagement, improves comment discoverability, and brings creators and viewers closer by aligning discussion with the moment itâ€™s about.

## Key Components

1.  Live-Linked Comment Sync A toggle switch allows users to view comments synced with the current video timestamp (Auto-sync).

As the video plays, relevant comments fade in and out subtly below the video.

2.  AI Comment Clustering Comments are grouped by:

Timestamp (e.g., 7:22)

Topic type: Funny, Insight, Question, Reaction

Top reactions are shown during the most active video moments.

3.  Smart Floating Comment Bubble A floating bubble alerts users when major comment clusters are tied to the moment.

Tapping expands a mini, scrollable view without interrupting video playback.

4.  Interactive Timeline Anchors Comment density is visualized on the video scrubber using heatmaps or markers.

Tapping these points jumps to the moment and previews the most-liked comments there.

5.  Topic Filters Native-feeling, scrollable tabs let users filter comments by:

Top Comment

Funny

Insight

Creator Picks

These adapt based on video type (e.g., tutorials, music, comedy).

6.  Minimalist Design for Mobile Compact, accessible, one-hand-usable layout.

Works seamlessly in vertical and horizontal modes.

7.  Creator Tools Creators can pin timestamped highlights, label reactions, and surface FAQs or insider notes.

## Key Features

This project replicates the core functionalities of YouTube, including:

*   **Video Streaming**: Users can upload and stream high-definition videos.
*   **User Authentication**: Secure sign-up/login using OAuth2.0.
*   **Video Recommendations**: A recommendation system that suggests relevant content based on user preferences.
*   **Cloud Integration**: Uploaded videos are stored in the cloud, with seamless playback across devices.

This project showcases a comprehensive technology stack involving full-stack web development and cloud services.
